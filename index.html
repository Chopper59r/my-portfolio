              at DkIT, and I’m passionate about applying cloud technologies to solve real

            <p>
             I study at TUD and currently undergoing my <strong>BSc (Hons) in Computing</strong>,where I have the
             foundational knowledge of web development, programming, scripting and many more along with the cloud 
             platforms like Azure and AWS. For my assignments and practicals, I developed full-stack prototypes,
             which included automated deployment scripts and cloud-hosted services that showcase my technical 
             prowess as well as my knowledge of scaling architecture. I like to work on solving problems. I also
             like working in cross‑functional teams. I also like to learn a lot through classwork and personal projects.
             I take a hands-on approach that focuses on practical outcomes, breaking down problems into testable 
             steps, writing maintainable code, and automating repetitive tasks to reduce human error.  I am good
             at both front-end and back-end development, building RESTful APIs and using Infrastructure as Code 
             for provisioning environments. My group works as well as labs have helped me to learn effective
             teamwork and communication skills. I always look to test cloud standards against real problems.  
            </p>

            <p>
              I am particularly interested in front-end development and
              user experience design, and I am eager to apply what I have
              learned in a professional environment such as an internship
              or graduate role.

                  This project is a website made on Studio Ghibli as a fan site 
                  using HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT and PHP. This site contains a 
                  beautiful homepage with themed links to History, Portfolio, 
                  Survey, and Giveaway, all styled after Ghibli. The website has
                  some animations and interaction from the user like a logout and
                  maybe some backend using PHP. Your layout and styling 
                  abilities are showcased through design, but also that some 
                  server-side logic is included for account management. All in all, 
                  the Ghibli-inspired work creatively fuses design, interactivity, and technical execution.
